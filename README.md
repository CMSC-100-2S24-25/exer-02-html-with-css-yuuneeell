## How To Create Your GitHub Page
### **Step 1: Set Up a GitHub Account**
1. If you don't have one, you can go and sign up on [GitHub](https://github.com/signup).
2. Verify your email address to complete the sign up.
### **Step 2: Create a New Repository**
1. Make sure to [log in](https://github.com/login) first to your GitHub account.
2. Click the `+` icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Choose **Public** (Note: Private repositories require a paid plan for GitHub Pages).
4. Add a description (if you like).
5. Check the box to **Initialize this repository with a README**.
6. Click **Create Repository**.


### **Step 3: Add Content to your Repository**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```
Replace `username` with your GitHub username.

2. Add your files (e.g., `index.html`, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to the repository folder.
3. Commit and push your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```


### **Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section in the left sidebar.
4. Under **Source**, select the branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and folder (e.g., `/root` or `/docs`) where your website files are located.
5. Click **Save**.


### **Step 5: Access Your GitHub Page**
1. After enabling GitHub Pages, wait a few minutes for the site to build.
2. Once the build is complete, you'll see a message with the URL of your GitHub Page (e.g., `https://username.github.io`).
3. Visit the URL in your browser to see your live site.


### **Step 6: Customize Your GitHub Page**
1. Add more content, such as:
    - An `index.html` file for the homepage.
    - CSS files for styling.
    - JavaScript for interactivity.
2. If done, you can push your updates to your repository to automatically update your GitHub Page.

## Key Takeaways from the Exercise
This exercise was very tricky at first since it's been so long since I created a webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS. But after creating my static webpage for the exercise, it reinforced and actually expanded my knowledge in writing HTML/CSS on designing a webpage. It also strengthened my skill in version control by integrating the use of git and GitHub on doing the exercise which makes managing my files easier and more efficient.
